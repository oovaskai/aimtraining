 First person shooter game

 A demo game developed by me, Olli Ovaskainen as a school project in 2019 when I was studying game programming at OSAO, Finland.
 The goal of the game is to kill all targets and complete time trial level as fast as possible while building muscle memory and   developing mechanical skills in FPS games.
