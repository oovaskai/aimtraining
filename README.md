 First person shooter game

 A demo game developed by me, Olli Ovaskainen as a school project in 2019 when I was studying game programming at OSAO, Finland.
 The goal of the game is to kill all targets and complete time trial level as fast as possible.

 Contains:
 - Builds: Latest builds for Windows x86
 - FPSAimTraining: Unity project folder
